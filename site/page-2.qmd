Here is a another page for organizing tutorials or specific analyses in the project. This can also contain protocols or other relevant information for project management. Whatever you would like.

You can add code blocks like normal:

```{r }

x = rnorm(10, 0, 1)
hist(x)
```

You can add latex formatting for inline equation $1 + 2 = 4$, or use the separate equation lines:

$$T = \sum_{i = 1}^{S} N_{i} T_{i}$$
