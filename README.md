# project-template

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of project-template is to make it easy to create a new project
with a website to allow for tutorials, project logs, protocols, etc.
This template can be used for new projects to standardize project
structure.

The template is build around a Quarto website to allow github pages to
be source from `docs/`. The Quarto website is configured in the
`_quarto.yml` file with the `output-dir: docs` command.

The layout of the website is also set in the `quarto.yml` document.
Website structure and additional pages can be added by modifying this
file.
