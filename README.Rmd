# project-template

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of project-template is to make it easy to create a new project with a website to allow for tutorials, project logs, protocols, etc. This template can be used for new projects to standardize project structure.

The template is build around a Quarto website to allow github pages to be source from `docs/`. The Quarto website is configured in the `_quarto.yml` file with the `output-dir: docs` command.

The layout of the website is also set in the `quarto.yml` document. Website structure and additional pages can be added by modifying this file.
